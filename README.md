## Block Types and Rules
Townscaper allows you to use up to 16 different types of blocks. Adjacent blocks of the same type can merge. 
You can choose to add a different block or the same block to force different architecture rules and may be able to get fancy doors and lighthouses or get less windows and more arches.

## Colors
By default, each type has an assigned color. You cannot add new colors, but you can replace the existing by using custom color palettes. 
After you replace the town palette and open an existing world - it will look very different!

### How to replace palette
NOTE: You cannot access or modify game files on all platforms. If you play Townscaper on PC you can try the instructions below.

1. Close Townscaper game.
2. Locate `TownPalette.png`
  - Windows - `C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\LocalLow\Oskar Stalberg\Townscaper\Textures`
  - MAC - `~/Library/Application\ Support/com.OskarStalberg.Townscaper/Textures` in the user folder
3. Copy `TownPalette.png` and save somewhere so you can put it back in case you need the original palette.
4. Clone or download this repository.
5. Open any folder containing new palette, for example, `\townscaper\TownPalettes\inverted` and copy `TownPalette.png`.
6. Replace the `TownPalette.png` in the Textures folder with the one you just copied.
7. Launch Townscaper game to test new palette.

## Requests and Contributions
I might add new palettes in the future, but I do not accept requests for new palettes/modifications.

### If you want to share your palettes
1. Fork this repository.
2. Add a new folder under TownPalettes and put your `TownPalette.png` in it.
3. Add, commit and push the new file.
4. Create a pull request.
